Given a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as L and R, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in [L, R] (R >= L). You might need to change the root of the tree, so the result should return the new root of the trimmed binary search tree.

Example 1:
Input: 
    1
   / \
  0   2

  L = 1
  R = 2

Output: 
    1
      \
       2
Example 2:
Input: 
    3
   / \
  0   4
   \
    2
   /
  1

  L = 1
  R = 3

Output: 
      3
     / 
   2

            if not tree:
                return None

            tree.left = trim(tree.left)
            tree.right = trim(tree.right)

            if L <= tree.val <= R:
                return tree

            if tree.val > R:
                return tree.left

            if tree.val < L:
                return tree.right
